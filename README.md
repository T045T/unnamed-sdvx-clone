A game based on [KShootMania](http://www.kshootmania.com/) and [SDVX](https://remywiki.com/What_is_SOUND_VOLTEX).

### Current features:
- Basic GUI (Buttons, Sliders, Scroll Boxes)
- OGG/MP3 Audio streaming (with preloading for gameplay performance)
- Uses KShoot charts (`*.ksh`) (1.6 supported)
- Functional gameplay and scoring
- Saving of local scores
- Autoplay
- Basic controller support (Still some issues with TC+)
- Changeable settings and key mapping in configuration file
- Skinning support
- Supports new sound FX method (real-time sound FX) and old sound FX method (separate NOFX & sound effected music files)
- Song database cache for near-instant game startup (sqlite3)
- Song database searching
- Linux/Windows support

### Features currently on hold / in progress:
- GUI remake
- Song select UI/Controls to change HiSpeed and other game settings

The folder that is scanned for songs can be changed in the "Main.cfg" file (`songfolder = "path to song folder"`).  
Make sure you use a *plain* text editor like Notepad, Notepad++ or gedit; NOT a *rich* text editor like Wordpad or Word!

If something breaks in the song database, delete "maps.db". **Please note this will also wipe saved scores.**

## Controls
### Game (Customizable, read 'Readme_Input.txt'):
- BTN (White notes): \[D\] \[F\] \[J\] \[K\]
- FX (Yellow notes) = \[C\] \[M\]
- VOL-L (Cyan laser, Move left / right) = \[W\] \[E\]
- VOL-R (Magenta laser) = \[O\] \[P\]
- Quit song & go back to song selection \[Esc\]

### Song Select:
- Use the arrow keys to select a song and difficulty
- Use \[Page Down\]/\[Page Up\] to scroll faster
- Press \[Enter\] to start a song
- Press \[Ctrl\]+\[Enter\] to start song with autoplay
- Use the Search bar on the top to search for songs

## How to run:
Just run 'Main_Release' or 'Main_Debug' from within the 'bin' folder. Or, to play a chart immediately:  
#### `{Download Location}/bin> Main_{Release or Debug} {path to *.ksh chart} [flags]`

#### Command line flags (all are optional):
- `-notitle` - Skips the title menu launching the game directly into song select.
- `-mute` - Mutes all audio output
- `-autoplay` - Plays chart automatically, no user input required
- `-autobuttons` Like autoplay, but just for the buttons. You only have to control the lasers
- `-autoskip` - Skips beginning of song to the first chart note
- `-convertmaps` - Allows converting of `*.ksh` charts to a binary format that loads faster (experimental, feature not complete)
- `-debug` - Used to show relevant debug info in game such as hit timings, and scoring debug info
- `-test` - Runs test scene, for development purposes only

## How to build:
